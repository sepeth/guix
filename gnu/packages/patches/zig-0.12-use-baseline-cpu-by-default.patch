Subject: [PATCH 4/5] Use `baseline` cpu by default.

This helps Guix tune the package later. Tunning will only add
`-Dcpu=whatever` which should override the standard behaviour.

Zig by default uses `native`, which interferes with our build process.
In our previous zig-build-system we chose to add `-Dcpu=baseline` flag
in each `zig build` execution, but that doesn't allow us to tune the
package later. Tunning is only designed to add extra flags in the
command line call, and we already had one set for the baseline case.
With this patch we set the standard behavior to `baseline` so we don't
need to add the `-Dcpu=baseline` flag in the zig-build-system and we can
tune with no issues.
