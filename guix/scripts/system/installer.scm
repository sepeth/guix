;;; Commentary:

;;; Implement the 'guix system installer' command, which runs the installer,
;;; directly as a Guix command, also in dry-run mode.
;;;
;;; Code:

(define %options
  (list (option '(#\n "dry-run") #f #f
                (lambda (opt name arg result)
                  (alist-cons 'dry-run? #t result)))
        (option '(#\h "help") #f #f
                (lambda args
                  (show-help)
                  (exit 0)))
        (option '(#\V "version") #f #f
                (lambda args
                  (show-version-and-exit "guix system installer")))))

(define (show-help)
  (display (G_ "Usage: guix system installer [OPTION]...

  (display (G_ "
  -h, --help             display this help and exit"))
  (display (G_ "
  -V, --version          display version information and exit"))
